# Archived Documentation

This directory contains historical, completed, or temporary documentation files that have been archived for reference but are no longer actively maintained.

## Archive Organization

### `/deployments/`
Deployment reports, migration status documents, and implementation completion summaries.

### `/test-results/`
Historical test results, testing checklists, and test execution reports for completed features.

### `/implementation-plans/`
Completed feature implementation plans, build specs, and development guides for features that are now deployed.

### `/cursor-prompts/`
Cursor AI agent prompts, merge prompts, and one-time development instructions that were used during implementation.

### `/old-files/`
Replaced or deprecated files (e.g., old README versions).

### `/fixes-and-audits/`
One-time fix documentation, validation reports, and audit documents for completed corrections.

### `/root-completion-notes/` (added Jan 2026)
One-off completion and status docs that lived at repo root: cleanup summaries, deployment complete/status, implementation complete notes, QB/Labor/SMS redeploy guides.

### `/contract-build-docs/` (added Jan 2026)
Contract feature build-time docs: `contract-generation-spec.md`, `contract-generation-cursor-prompts.md`, `CONTRACT_TEMPLATE_TEST_RESULTS.md`. Current contract reference: root `CONTRACT_MIGRATIONS_APPLIED.md` and `docs/contract-template-setup.md`, `docs/contract-template-final-docs.md`.

### `/quickbooks-artifacts/`
Generated or one-off QuickBooks workflow artifacts (e.g. compass export with hash filenames). Active QB docs remain in `docs/quickbooks/`.
